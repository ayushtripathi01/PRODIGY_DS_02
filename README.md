I cleaned the data by handling missing values in 'Age' and 'Embarked' columns. Exploratory analysis showed that females and 1st class passengers had higher survival rates. Most passengers were aged between 20â€“40 and paid lower fares. Correlation analysis confirmed survival was linked to gender, class, and age.
